These are my coding projects to help me understand Python, in this repository is:

- vigenere cipher solver (I have no clue if this works, I wrote it a long time ago and I was very new to Python, still am)
- Pixel editor, this program was made for an assignment where we had to use bsub to change the pixels in a BMP image, this code automates it to where you can make an Excel sheet with the dimensions of the BMP image and mark down the coordinates of the pixels you want to change and this will give you a list of the bsub commands to change it
- PX viewer, this program was made for a CTF challenge. PX translator will translate a VGA image file with pixel brightness values into an array of RGB values that can be displayed using the PX viewer
- Pancake bot, this is my favorite one, this is a script that will automatically play every game from the discord pancake bot https://pancake.gg/ . the trivia db filler scrawls opentdb and fills out answers to the trivia questions and the pancake script will automatically answer highlow, then fish, then work, then trivia. This script was a lot of fun to make and taught me a lot about web requests as it sends a web requests to get the messages from the bot. this script is MK1 as im not ready to release MK2 (I haven't taken over our discord pancake leaderboard to the point where i cannot be overthrown yet). MK1 still has full functionality, just some bugs are not fixed and it may be vulnerable to an sql injection attack(someone could drop your table) plus if someone pulls the help menu up while its doing trivia the program will crash. you can try to exploit these issues or fix them yourself or just wait till i obtain godhood in a pancake leaderboard
