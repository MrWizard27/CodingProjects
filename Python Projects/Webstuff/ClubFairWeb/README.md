# This contains web and serial Python programs that were used to advertise the cyber defense club during the club fair

1. FlipperControl.py: This is a simple serial terminal program, I was trying to figure out how to communicate with my flipper so I could use it at club fair and this is what I made
2. LogWeb.py: This Program creates a flask web server that holds an updating array of the website's logs, this is meant to show people what a website sees when you log into it. It also sends a signal to a flipper zero to send ir commands to flash some ir led lights whenever someone visits the website
